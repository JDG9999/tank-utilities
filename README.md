# Tank utilities

Javascript app that controls the level of a tank. 

- The tank maximum and minimum capacity can be adjusted.
- A minimum and maximum threshold can be activated to show if the water level is at a dangerous level. The water turns red (max) or yellow (min) in such cases.
- Water movement is shown with a simple JS animation.
